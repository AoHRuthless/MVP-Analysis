MVP analysis and prediction for 2017 MVP winner of the NBA

MVP Prediction using previous mvp data from http://www.nba.com/history/nba-mvp-award-winners/
coerced with advanced basketball statistics available from http://www.basketball-reference.com/

For the 2017 NBA Season, the data indicates with reasonable likelihood (using Bayesian GLM)
that the MVP award should go to Russell Westbrook (OKC).
Runner-ups: James Harden (HOU), Stephen Curry (GSW).
